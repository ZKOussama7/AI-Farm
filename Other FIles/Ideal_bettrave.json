The ideal soil moisture level is between 60% to 70% during the early growth stage and between 50% to 60% during the late growth stages. The ideal length of the Bettrave plant is around 6 to 8cm during early growth stages and around 20 to 25cm during late growth stages. The ideal range of wind speed is around 1 to 2 m/s during early growth stages and 0.5 to 1.5 m/s during late phases.",
