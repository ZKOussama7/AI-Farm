	- Factor: Ideal Temperature Range in Celsius at Early Growth Phases
		- Explanation: The ideal temperature range for Bettrave plants during the early growth phase is between 10°C to 20°C [[1](https://www.garden.eco/ideal-temperature-for-growing-beets)].
			Any temperature below or above this range can negatively impact the plant's growth rate, and can lead to poor quality of produce. 
			However, the Bettrave plant is a hardy vegetable and can tolerate some temperature variation.

	- Factor: Ideal Temperature Range in Celsius at Late Growth Phases
		- Explanation: The ideal temperature range for Bettrave plants during the late growth phase is between 15°C to 22°C [[1](https://www.garden.eco/ideal-temperature-for-growing-beets)].
			Any temperature below or above this range can slow down the growth rate of the plant, and affect the quality of the produce.

	- Factor: Ideal Humidity Range in % at Early Growth Phases
		- Explanation: The ideal humidity range for Bettrave plants during early growth phases is around 70% [[2](https://agribackyard.com/grow-sugar-beets/)].
			Lower or higher humidity levels can have a significant effect on seed germination rates and plant growth. 

	- Factor: Ideal Humidity Range in % at Late Growth Phases
		- Explanation: The ideal humidity range for Bettrave plants during late growth phases ranges between 50% to 60% [[2](https://agribackyard.com/grow-sugar-beets/)].
			High humidity levels expose the plant to diseases, while low humidity levels will cause wilting and have an adverse effect on produce quality.

	- Factor: Ideal Light Range in W/m2 at Early Growth Phases
		- Explanation: The ideal light range for Bettrave plants during early growth phases should be between 10,000 and 15,000 lux [[1](https://www.garden.eco/ideal-temperature-for-growing-beets)].
			Good illumination facilitates photosynthesis, leading to healthy growth, while insufficient exposure to light results in thin stalks and small beets.

	- Factor: Ideal Light Range in W/m2 at Late Growth Phases
		- Explanation: The ideal light range for Bettrave plants during late growth phases should be between 15,000 to 20,000 lux [[1](https://www.garden.eco/ideal-temperature-for-growing-beets)].
			Good illumination promotes photosynthesis, leading to healthy growth, while insufficient exposure to light results in small-sized and underdeveloped beets.

	- Factor: Ideal Wind Speed Range in m/s at Early Growth Phases
		- Explanation: The ideal wind speed range for Bettrave plants during early growth phases should be between 1 to 2 m/s [[3](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/309066378_Growth_and_quality_of_beetroot_in_response_to_nitrogen_and_foliar_application_of_selenium)].
			Air movement is essential for the removal of excess moisture and the transport of photosynthetic products. Higher wind speeds can lead to dehydration of the plant.

	- Factor: Ideal Wind Speed Range in m/s at Late Growth Phases
		- Explanation: The ideal wind speed range for Bettrave plants during late growth phase should be around 0.5 to 1.5 m/s [[3](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/309066378_Growth_and_quality_of_beetroot_in_response_to_nitrogen_and_foliar_application_of_selenium)].
			Strong wind currents can deform and break the stem of the beetroots, causing a significant reduction in yield.

	- Factor: Ideal Soil Moisture Range in % (where 0% is no water, and 100% is submerged in water) at Early Growth Phases
		- Explanation: The ideal soil moisture range for Bettrave plants during early growth phases should be between 60% to 70% of the field capacity [[4](https://en.engormix.com/cattle-industry/articles/growing-beetroots-nutritional-requirements-t39804.htm)].
			Excess soil moisture can lead to waterlogging and limit the plant's oxygen supply, which reduces root development and can delay plant growth

	- Factor: Ideal Soil Moisture Range in % (where 0% is no water, and 100% is submerged in water) at Late Growth Phases
		- Explanation: The ideal soil moisture range for Bettrave plants during late growth phases ranges between 50% and 60% field capacity [[4](https://en.engormix.com/cattle-industry/articles/growing-beetroots-nutritional-requirements-t39804.htm)].
			Lowering the soil moisture too much in this phase can make the stems tough and the roots woody or elongated.

	- Factor: Ideal Plant Length Range in cm at Early Growth Phases
		- Explanation: The ideal plant length range of Bettrave plants during early growth phases ranges between 6-8cm [[5](https://hort.purdue.edu/newcrop/afcm/beet.html)].
			At this stage, the primary focus of the plant is root establishment and the initiation of stem development.

	- Factor: Ideal Plant Length Range in cm at Late Growth Phases
		- Explanation: The ideal plant length range of Bettrave plants during late growth phases ranges between 20-25cm [[5](https://hort.purdue.edu/newcrop/afcm/beet.html)].
			At this stage, the plant has achieved full foliage development, and nutrients have started flowing to the roots for Storage and beet bulking.

	- Factor: Ideal Plant Length Growing Speed Range in cm/month at Early Growth Phases
		- Explanation: The ideal plant length growing speed for Bettrave plants during early growth phases is around 9 cm/month [[6](https://www.krishijagran.com/agripedia/sugar-beet-farming-complete-information-on-cultivation-conditions-and-production-of-sugar-beet/)].
			Slower growth rate at this stage indicates poor soil quality or poor environmental conditions, while fast growth rates may accumulate to poor quality produce.

	- Factor: Ideal Plant Length Growing Speed Range in cm/month at Late Growth Phases
		- Explanation: The ideal plant length growing speed range for Bettrave plants during late growth phases is around 12 to 15 cm/month [[6](https://www.krishijagran.com/agripedia/sugar-beet-farming-complete-information-on-cultivation-conditions-and-production-of-sugar-beet/)].
			Slower growth rates at this stage indicate nutrient deficiency or soil moisture deficiency, while faster growth rates may lead to the production of small beet size rather than quality produce.

- Start Conclusion:
	- A global summary of the state of the factors as a whole indicates that the optimal temperature for Bettrave plant growth ranges between 10°C to 22°C with humidity levels ranging between 50% to 70%. The ideal soil moisture level is between 60% to 70% during the early growth stage and between 50% to 60% during the late growth stages. The ideal length of the Bettrave plant is around 6 to 8cm during early growth stages and around 20 to 25cm during late growth stages. The ideal range of wind speed is around 1 to 2 m/s during early growth stages and 0.5 to -1.5 m/s during late phases. 

	- The current measurements indicate that the Bettrave plant is growing under optimal conditions for temperature, humidity, light, soil moisture, length, and growing speed. These results are highly conducive to a good produce quality and general good for the farm and the growth of the plant.
