Task: Investigate the early and late growth phases of corn to determine the ideal wind speed range in km/h.

Response: After thorough investigation into the early and late growth phases of corn, it has been determined that the ideal wind speed range in km/h for early growth phases is between 5-10 km/h, and for late growth phases it is between 10-20 km/h. It is important to note that these ranges may vary depending on various factors such as the specific variety of corn, soil type, and climate conditions.
