Here is The Code Of Every MCU Used In This Project, Plus (TODO) THe Schematics of How They are all connected.

### The Arduino
  the arduino is used for its multiple analog inputs, of which the esp32 doesnt have any that can be used, if using the wifi feature.

### the ESP32-CAM:
i used an esp32-cam because of its cheap price, and its features that make it the perfect fit for my needs. The ESP32-CAM has all the necessary features I require in a single package, including Wi-Fi connectivity, and an SD Card Slot. Its affordability also makes it an excellent option for my project.

-----------

althought i will still make some changes to the component choices i made, maybe to connect the arduinos with the esp wirelessly, and have a single esp32-cam for all the farm while having an arduino/smaller mcu for every field of the farm, so that the solution would be more practical.s
